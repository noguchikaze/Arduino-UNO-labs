# Arduino-UNO-labs
Our eelab uses Arduino uno combining with the circuits

LAB5
  There are 4 labs in LAB5.
    Lab1 
      make the LED blink for 0.5, 1 and 2 Hz
    Lab2
      Understand how to utilize the "pull-high" and "pull-low" circuit
      and make use of it through attatching it to the 7-segment LED
    Lab3
      Change the output in order to let each LED of the 7-seg light for once in a loop
      and combine it with the push-button, change the state while the state of push-button changes
    Lab4
      Modify the sketch in Lab3, make the 7-seg run your std ID
    Bonus
